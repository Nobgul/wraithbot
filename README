wraithbot 0.0.1
===============

This is the Clan iCu* IRC bot running on gamesurge in #icu and #ftwgl.  I
started this because I was tired of xqf and qstat and wanted a way to query
servers with filters for certain clans.  Since everyone can see the output,
it's more social and we get more people to join that way.  It also has filters
to report when pubs have bots (yuck) or when mid to top tier clans are playing.

The setup isn't the greatest.  I started off with a small script to query
game servers and it grew from there.  These should probably be plugins like
other IRC bots use.

Note that it does heavy filtering on the names.  In general, any user input is
(overly) sanitized.  Without doing a lot more investigation, there isn't a list
of what input could be malicious to irssi bots.  Therefore, I'm overly cautious.


Configuration
-------------

Most of the configuration that can rapidly change (TS3 servers, UrT servers, or
clans) are in the conf/ directory.


Background
----------

This is an IRC bot using irssi.  It uses Perl because that's all irssi supports.
I opted for writing an IRC bot in Perl for irssi versus standalone clients like
gozerbot, phenny, supybot, etc because this is a full fledged client with all
the nice features of irssi.

If you're looking for an IRC client to use without a bot, irssi is the best one
that I have found.

This bot requires a number of packages in order to run.  It's designed for an
Unix-like operating system.  I use it with Debian.


Requirements
------------

You'll need the following programs:

irssi
perl
fortune   # optional

And these Perl modules

Net::Telnet
Text::Wrap
Readonly
IPC::System::Simple
version 0.77 or above

# These are needed for some tests but not the execution
Perl::Critic
Perl::Critic::Utils
Test::Perl::Critic


Usage
-----

To load this bot, place everything in ~/.irssi/scripts and then run:

/script load urt_bot

If you want to unload the bot, use:

/script reset

as this will unload everything.  If you only do:

/script unload urt_bot

then it doesn't unload everything because we're loading modules.


NOTES
-----

I get 3 of these on the first call to @servers.  I have found lots of people with the same problem
but no one has an answer.  It doesn't appear to affect anything.

Can't locate package Irssi::Nick for @Irssi::Irc::Nick::ISA at <PATH> line <XYZ>.

It's an open bug since 2005: http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=242&project=5&pagenum=12

If you modify this, try to make the output as condensed as possible to avoid client/server
buffering.

Be careful with regex that reference channels.  I'm using /x which makes '#' a comment.  You need to either
use quotemeta or escape the '#' so it doesn't effectively end the regex.
